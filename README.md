About This Repo
===============

This repo contains a list of the most common Japanese words in order of frequency, as determined by the [University of Leeds Corpus](http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/frqc/internet-jp.num).

Usage
-----

This repo is useful as a corpus for typing training programs. According to analysis of the [Oxford English Corpus](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/what-can-corpus-tell-us-about-language/), the 7,000 most common English lemmas account for approximately 90% of usage, so a 15,000 word training corpus is more than sufficient for practical training applications.

To use this list as a training corpus in [Amphetype](https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype/), paste the contents into the "Lesson Generator" tab with the following settings:

    Make **3** copies of the list

    Divide into sublists of size **3**

    Add to sources as **15000-japanese-words**

In the "Sources" tab, you should see **15000-japanese-words** available for training. Set WPM at 10 more than your current average, set accuracy to 98%, and you're set to train.

Enjoy!
